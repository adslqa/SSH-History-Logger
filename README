SSH History Logger

SSH History Logger is a small wrapper shell script around the 'ssh' command,
which saves the output and input of your ssh sessions.

Loosely following the convention set by shells, it creates a folder in your
$HOME folder called .ssh_history, then places log files there for each session
you have over ssh (assuming you invoked ssh through it).

It strives to be completely transparent, so that you don't have to change your
command line syntax for invoking the ssh command when using it. Simply invoke
'sshh' instead of 'ssh' with the same options you would use normally with ssh,
and so long as the ssh command is also in your path and it can create your log
files and (if needed) set up your ~/.ssh_history folder for you succesfully,
it'll "just work".
